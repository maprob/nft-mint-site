## Installation 🛠️

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/The-Stripes-NFT/nft-minting-app.git
```

Make sure you have node.js installed so you can use npm, then run:

```sh
npm -i
npm start
```
